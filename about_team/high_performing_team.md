# Steps towards high performance team

- 14 characteristcs
- vision
- purpose

## Product Vision

- establish a common goal for everyone in a team
- the Product Owner is responsible for creating the common goal for the team
- should respond to "WHY they should work in the team"
- should respond to "WHAT they need to accomplish as a team"
- the Product Owner should not define HOW the team should work. This is team's responsibility.

## Help a team to define their definition of awesomeness

- To help them create a "dream team"
- ask to the team : what the meaning of "awesomeness is" ?
- ask to the team : when they think about an "awesome team", what does it represent for them ?

Can be splitted in :
- **Technical awesomeness**: Being able to release in every check in, 100% test coverage, 0% manual testing, ATTD Gurus, etc.
- **People awesomeness**: The best group of individuals in the world, the team that has a lot of fun, the team that helps each other at every moment of the day, etc.
- **Innovativeness awesomeness**: The most innovative team in the world, the team always comes up with new fresh ideas, etc.

## Help a team to select their values

In a scrum team, there are five values :
- **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
- **Courage**: Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
- **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
- **Commitment**: People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
- **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

On top of these values, select two or three more values to help the team to create their identity.

Everyone acts based on their values; therefore defining team values is a highly important activity that brings people together.
