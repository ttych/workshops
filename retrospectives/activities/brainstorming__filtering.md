# Retrospective

- **iteration**
- **release**
- **project**

# Phase

- generate insights

# Purpose

Generate a large number of ideas and filter them against a defined set of criteria.

# Time Needed

40 to 60 minutes.

# Description

Team members generate ideas using traditional brainstorming,
then test whether each idea is applicable to the current situation.

# Steps

1. Introduce the activity by saying
   "Because we need to push beyond our usual thinking,
   we're going to spend the next chunk of time brainstorming.
   Once we've generated new approaches,
   we'll filter the ideas to find the ones that fit best for our situation."

2. Describe the guidelines for brainstorming.
   Challenge the group to come up with fifty ideas,
   and set the time limit, usually ten to fifteen minutes.

3. Brainstorm using one of three methods:
   - Brainstorming Method 1:
     Free-for-all. People call out ideas at random.
   - Brainstorming Method 2:
     Round-robin. Pass a "talking token" around the circle.
     Only the person holding the talking token can talk.
     It's OK to pass when your turn comes.
   - Brainstorming Method 3:
     Give people five to seven minutes to silently
     and individually generate and write down ideas.
     When the time is up, use Brainstorming Method 1 or 2.
   - Monitor time, and call when the time has run out.

4. Ask the group what filters they should apply to the ideas.\
   Accept four to eight suggestions,
   discuss,
   and then vote using a show of hands on the top four.
   Write the four selected filters on a separate flip chart page or on the white board.

5. Apply the filters one at a time to the ideas on the brainstorm lists.
   Cross out items that don't pass the filters.
   Mark ideas that pass each filter.
   Use a different color for each filter.

6. Look for ideas that pass all four filters.

7. Ask for comments on the ideas. Ask the group which ideas they want to carry forward.
   Ask whether anyone feels strongly about taking responsibility for any of the ideas.
   If someone feels strongly, it's a good bet to carry forward.
   Otherwise, use the simple majority vote.

8. Carry the selected ideas into the next phase, Decide What to Do.

# Examples

Brainstorming has been around for years, and many people have heard of it.

The problem with traditional brainstorming (Brainstorming Method 1) is that
it favors people who are comfortable thinking aloud.
It also favors people who are comfortable shouting out their thoughts in a group.
That leaves out many smart, creative people.

Brainstorming Method 2 helps people who aren't comfortable shouting out in a group participate
and leaves an escape (saying "pass") to people who haven't thought of anything... yet.

Brainstorming Method 3 helps people who need time to gather their thoughts (like Esther) time to do that,
and then they're ready to participate in Brainstorming Method 1 or 2.

A fourth variation on the activity is to take the ideas generated in Brainstorming Method 3
and write them on cards and then hand them to the retrospective leader, who posts them and reads them.
Even the quietest person can write his or her idea on a card for someone else to read.
