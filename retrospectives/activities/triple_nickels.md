# Retrospective

- **iteration**
- **release**
- **project**

# Phase

- **Gather Data**
- part of the **Decide What to Do phase**

# Purpose

- Generate ideas for actions or recommendations.
- Uncover important topics about the project history.

# Time Needed

30 to 60 minutes (depending on the size of the group).

# Description

- Form small groups.
- In the groups, each person has five minutes to brainstorm and write down ideas individually.
- At the end of five minutes, each person passes the paper to the person on his or her right.
- That person has five minutes to write down ideas that build on the ideas already written on the paper.
- Repeat until the paper returns to the original writer.

# Steps

1. Set up the activity by saying "In this activity, our goal is to generate as many ideas as we can about [topic]."
   Then explain the process (see the brief description earlier).
2. Divide the team into small groups, with no more than five in a group.
   Hand out paper for people to write on.
   Make sure each person has a pen or pencil.
   Remind people to write legibly so the next person can read the ideas.
3. Describe the process: In the first round, each person will have five minutes to write down ideas related to the topic.
   Aim for at least five ideas.
   In subsequent rounds, each person writes ideas that are sparked by the already written ideas or builds on them in some way.
4. Time the group.
   After five minutes, ring a chime and tell the group to pass the paper to the right.
5. Ask each person to read the ideas listed on the paper.
6. Debrief using these questions:
   - What did you notice while you wrote ideas?
   - What surprised you? What met your expectations? How?
   - What is missing from these lists?
   - What ideas and topics should we examine further?
Use the ideas generated into the next activity.

# Materials and Preparation:

Paper. Pens or pencils.

# Variations

If there are seven or fewer people in the group, don't divide into small groups; do the activity as whole group.
Pass the paper only five times.

# Examples

With a team of mostly reticent developers and one or two outspoken individuals,
an activity like Triple Nickels can allow team members time to think privately
yet participate in a process that develops whole-team understanding.
It also prevents the few people who are comfortable talking in a group from dominating the discussion.
In Triple Nickels, everyone gets the chance to contribute equally to developing the data set,
and by the time the data is out, even the more reticent folks usually have something to say about what they wrote or read.

To help the five members of an internal business applications team gather data about their iteration,
Aswaria, the retrospective leader, introduced the Triple Nickels activity.
She divided the ten people on the team into two groups and passed out paper tablets and pens.

"I'll give you each five minutes to write down five important events that happened during our iteration.
Record things you saw or heard during the past fifteen days. Write legibly; make sure someone else can read it."

At the end of five minutes, she said,
"Now pass your papers to the right. Read what you get.
You have five minutes to add detail to the items there or add new, related events."

The team kept passing the papers until each member received their original paper back to read.
Some team members laughed at comments; others were shaking their heads. To maintain the theme of "fives",
Aswaria debriefed with questions such as the following:
- "What five things stand out for you about what you've read?"
- "What five events produced the strongest reactions?"
- "What are the five most significant events?"

After they finished the discussion, she handed out sticky drafting dots
and invited people to post the papers on an area of the wall that she
had labeled "Iteration History."
