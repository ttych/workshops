> "all models are wrong, but some are useful" -  George Box

# Target / Goal

## For the Team/Squad

- self-awareness (what's working and what's not)
- expand perspective (new topic ?)
- balanced perspective (good and pain)
- the team members gain insights while having the discussion

## For People supporting the Team/Squad

- managers and coaches
- high level summary (what's working and what's not)
- patterns accross multiple team
- the scrum-master/coach gains insights on how to effectively help the team
- The manager's attitude should be "how can I help?" and not "why are you guys worse than the others?".

## For All

> The first step in solving a problem is to be aware of it. And this type of visualization makes it harder for everyone to ignore the problem.

## When ?

Quarterly seems to be a good starting point though.

# Run it

|    | 1 hour | 2 hours |
| -- | ------ | ------- |
| Set the Stage           | 5min | 15min |
| Gather Data             | 27min | 30min |
| Generate Insights       | 16min | 30min |
| Decide What to Do       | 5min | 30min |
| Close the Retrospective | 2min | 15min |

## Set the Stage

limit to about 10 criteria/question :
- questions are about the environment in which the squad operates, and not about hard output (such as velocity)
- reinforces the notion that the survey is about support and improvement, not judgement
- our assumption (true or not) is that a squad intrinsically wants to succeed, and will perform as well as it can under given circumstances.

The exercise :
- use **health check model** name instead of **maturity**.
- be clear about your motives for introducing the model. It should about
improvement, not judgement.
- Present the current (11) criteria (3min)
- Present the voting method (1min)
  - Green = happy with current situation (!= perfect situation) ; no need to improve now
  - Orange = real problem to be handled, but not urgent now
  - red = doesn't work, and should be handled as soon as possible

Update the topics ? (1min)
- remove irrelevant topic ?
- miss a specific area ?

3min + 1min + 1min = 4min

## Gather Data

For each criteria (2min / criteria) do :
- read the criteria & examples (green, red)
- every participant decided for themselves
- the team vote for a color
- the team choose a tendency (better, stable, worse)

2min30 x 11 = 27min30

## Generate Insights (retrospective case)


### version 1
For each criteria, each team member should write 1 action per criteria
- 5 min max
For each criteria :
- each member give his action
- each member votes by pointing with finger
- keep 1 action per criteria
- if no consensus, new action can be selected by rewording a previous

5 min + 11 min = 16min

### version 2
Dot voting, between the (up-to) 11 actions :
- criteria with more discussion more divergence ?
- criteria with more oposition ?
- let the team vote (3 votes per team member)

Each Team member write up-to 2 action (5 min)

Share and decide (reword if needed) (9 min)


## Decide What to Do

Dot voting, between the (up-to) 11 actions :
- 3 votes per team member
- take 1,2,3 most rated actions

5 min

## Feedback

- The data gathering process needs to be interesting and fun.
- Involve teams in how the model is applied, and let them modify it as they see fit.
- The team may choose different questions
- "Is this model helping you?",  "If we stopped doing health checks, would you miss them?",  "How could we make this model more useful?".
- continuously improve the exercise

# Usage

Read it :
- scan each column, and you see some major differences between squads.
- scan each row, and you see systemic/common patterns.
- scan the overall picture, and you see that just about every arrow is up, only two down arrow in the whole picture.

Check :
- are they just optimistic and not seeing their own problems?
- but how do they know? Is that based on wishful thinking or real customer feedback?

Environment :
- all based on the honesty and subjective opinions of the people in the squads
- high-trust environment, where people trust their managers and colleagues to act in their best interest.
- this is a support tool, not a judgement tool.
